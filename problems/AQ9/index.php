<h1> Efficient Primes</h1>
<h3> Problem Statement </h3>
<p>
    Given a number output "YES" if the number is prime and "NO" if the number is not.
    <br>
    A number is considered prime if the only divisors of the number are 1 and the number itself.<br>
    Note: 1 is not a prime number.
 </p>
    
<h3> Input Description </h3>
    The first line contains a number t, the number of test cases. <br>
    The next t lines each contain a number n, the prime.
<h3> Output Description </h3>
	Print t lines, each containing "YES" if n is prime, or "NO" if it is not. (quotes only for clarity) <br>
<h3> Constraints </h3>
    Note: Constraints are <b>GUARANTEED</b> declarations of what the input will be like, you do not need to check for them. <br>
    The reason the constraints exist will especially be apparent in this problem. If you write a solution that takes more than sqrt(n) operations, <br>
    your submissions will probably time out.
